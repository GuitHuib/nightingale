      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p class="pb-4">
        Nightingale Ensemble uses music as a tool for social change by
        commissioning new works from a diverse group that represent the breadth
        and depth of classical composers in the modern world.
      </p>
      <p class="pb-4">
        The ensemble partners with composers and other musicians to broaden
        the repertoire for instruments and push musical pairings to find
        exciting, new soundscapes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nightingale Ensemble emphasizes finding contemporary composers who
        will bring a unique voice to their compositions through a range of
        backgrounds that are as diverse as our world is today!
